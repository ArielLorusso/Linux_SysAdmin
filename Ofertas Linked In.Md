Hi Ariel,

I’ve reviewed your CV, and it’s clear you have a solid technical background and a strong passion for development, DevOps, and backend work. Your experience in various programming languages and technologies like Python, C++, and Docker is impressive, and you’ve worked on some great projects, particularly with embedded systems and web development.

To make your CV even more appealing to recruiters, I’d suggest simplifying some of the technical details while keeping your core skills and achievements clear. Let’s highlight your key strengths in areas like DevOps, backend development, and AI/Big Data, which will help align you better with the roles you’re targeting.

Also, I’d recommend adding a section on how your skills have impacted past projects or teams—quantifying your contributions can make a big difference.

We can work together to make this a standout CV for your next big opportunity!

What do you think?

The teams i form part of are not so big but i'll try to include communications skills. Didn't know Big Data was related to DevOps, Thought it was more a king of AI & DataBases.
Should i make enfasis on Big Data when searching for DevOps positions ?
