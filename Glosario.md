let's say some programer is looking forward to do several job interviews
what terminology would he need to know to have success ?
make a list of terminology / concepts a programmer is expected to understand
example:
Cloud, API, IaaS, PaaS, SaaS,  Availability Zone,  DevOps, Reliability
Network, GateAway, IP, DNS, Net mask, CIDR, TCP, HTTPS, Query, Hash, Encryption, SSL,SSH
Runtime, Interpreter, Compiler, Framework, IDE, `Stack, Queue`, Segment Fault, `Garbage collection`, 
Pointer, `RegEx,` Hash Map,  DSA,  Hook,
Server, OS, VM, Process, Daemon ,FileSystem, Root, RAM, HHD, CPU

Please complete my list of terminology. Any good website to help me on my glossary ?

Here's a list of additional terms a programmer should be familiar with for job interviews:

## Programming Languages and Paradigms:

`Object-Oriented` Programming (`OOP`): Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
`Functional` Programming: Pure functions, immutability, higher-order functions, recursion
`Scripting` Languages: Python, JavaScript, Bash
`Compiled` Languages: C, C++, Java
`Static `Typing: Type checking at compile time
`Dynamic` Typing: Type checking at runtime

## Data Structures and Algorithms:

`Linked List`: Singly linked list, doubly linked list
`Tree`: Binary tree, binary search tree, AVL tree, red-black tree
`Graph`: Directed graph, undirected graph, graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS)
`Hash Table`: Hash function, collision handling
`Sorting` Algorithms: Bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, heap sort
`Searching `Algorithms: Linear search, binary search

## Database Concepts:
Relational Databases: `SQL`, normalization, `ACID` properties
NoSQL Databases: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis
`Data Modeling`: ER diagrams, data normalization
`Database Queries`: SQL syntax, joins, aggregations


## Software Design and Architecture:
Design Patterns: Singleton, Factory, Observer, Decorator
`Software Architecture`: Microservices, monolithic architecture, layered architecture
Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC): Waterfall, Agile, Scrum, Kanban

Version Control: Git, SVN

## Cloud Computing:
`Cloud Providers`: AWS, Azure, GCP
`Serverless Computing:` Lambda functions, Cloud Functions
`Containerization`: Docker, Kubernetes
`Infrastructure as Code (IaC)`: Terraform, Ansible

## Web Development:
HTTP: Request-response cycle, status codes
HTML: Structure of web pages
CSS: Styling of web pages
JavaScript: Client-side scripting
Web Frameworks: React, Angular, Vue.js, Django, Flask

## Software Testing:
`Unit Testing`: Testing individual components
`Integration Testing`: Testing the interaction between components
System Testing: Testing the entire system   
Acceptance Testing: Testing from the user's perspective

## Great expansion and organization.
What about more concepts like Layered Architecture (Presentation,Business,Data)
Or model view controller ?
Are there more terms a developer should know ?


## Excellent questions! Here are some additional concepts that developers should be familiar with, 
especially in the context of software architecture and design:

## Software Architecture:

`3 Layered Architecture`: This architecture separates the application into distinct layers, 
such as `presentation`, `business logic`, and `data access`. 
It promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability.

`MVC` Model-View-Controller :  Model View Controller

Microservices Architecture: A design approach that breaks down an application into small,
independent services that communicate via APIs.

### Software development philosophies

Event  Driven  Architecture: An architecture where components communicate by producing and consuming events.
Data   Driven  Development
Test   Driven  Development
Domain Driven  Design

ACID  (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) is a set of properties of database transactions 
CRUD  Create Read Update Delete

`callstack`, `callback`, `sidefects`,`mutation`,`mathod`,`atributes`, `garbage collection`


## Design Patterns:
`Factory` Pattern  : Creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic.
`Singleton` Pattern: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
Observer Pattern : Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects,  when one object changes state,
all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.   
`Decorator` Pattern: Dynamically adds responsibilities to an object without altering its class.

## Software Development Practices:
`Agile` Development: Iterative and incremental development methodology that emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and customer satisfaction.
`(CI/CD)` Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery : Automated practices for building, testing, and deploying software.
Refactoring: Restructuring code without changing its external behavior, to improve its readability, maintainability, and efficiency.

## Additional Technical Terms:

`API Gateway`: A service that acts as a single entry point for clients to access microservices.
`Load Balancer`: Distributes traffic across multiple servers to improve performance and availability.
`Caching`: Storing frequently accessed data in memory to improve performance.
`Asynchronous Programming`: Executing tasks concurrently without blocking the main thread.
`Testing Pyramid`: A concept that suggests that unit tests should be more numerous than integration tests, 
and integration tests should be more numerous than end-to-end tests.
